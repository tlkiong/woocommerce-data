# woocommerce-data
This is a repository of WooCommerce Data in a standard format (YAML / JSON) that is not accessible from their REST API

#### TODO:
1. Split into locales
2. Folder structure maybe like:
    continent
      country
        state
3. Need a generator that will combine & convert all the info into 1 giant yaml file or json (maybe under ./dist folder?)
